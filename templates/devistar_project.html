      Designing a secure, role-based business information system for a multi-branch wire manufacturer —
      integrating automation, analytics, and intelligent data management.

<!-- PROJECT OVERVIEW -->
<section class="container py-5">
  <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">🏢 Project Overview</h3>
  <p>
    This project involved designing and implementing a <strong>role-based business information system</strong>
    in Microsoft Access for <strong>Devistar Wire Company</strong>, a manufacturing and distribution firm in Nigeria.
    The system centralizes operations such as copper sourcing, coating imports, semi-finished production, inventory management, and branch-level sales reporting.
  </p>

  <p>
    Previously, the company relied on spreadsheets that caused inconsistencies and inefficiencies.
    This new system introduced secure authentication, user-specific dashboards, and automated reports for customers, employees, and managers.

<!-- SYSTEM FEATURES -->
<section class="container py-4">
  <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">💡 System Features & Design</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Role-Based Access:</strong> Login authentication (via <code>LoginTbl</code>) assigns access to Customers, Employees, or Managers with DLookup-based redirection.</li>
    <li><strong>Database Architecture:</strong> UML Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) linking all core tables with referential integrity across customers, products, and orders.</li>
    <li><strong>Operational Workflow:</strong> Tracks copper sourcing, coating imports, production batches, and finished goods sales per branch.</li>
    <li><strong>User Interfaces:</strong> Role-specific dashboards for customers, employees, and managers with dynamic form visibility and real-time data validation.</li>
    <li><strong>Automation:</strong> VBA scripts automate validation, conditional formatting, and live calculations (e.g., low stock alerts).</li>
    <li><strong>Reporting:</strong> Parameterized queries and printable reports filtered by branch, customer, or date — supporting informed decisions.</li>
  </ol>

<!-- REFLECTION -->
<section class="container py-4">
  <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">🧠 Reflection on Learning</h3>
  <p>
    Using Gibbs’ Reflective Cycle, I learned how to bridge theoretical database principles with practical usability.
    Overcoming challenges in VBA scripting, relationship design, and interface logic deepened my confidence in developing
    professional-grade business systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project also enhanced my skills in <strong>VBA automation, normalization, and user experience design</strong> —
    balancing technical precision with real-world accessibility.
  </p>

<!-- ✅ PROJECT OUTCOME SECTION -->
<section class="container py-5">
  <h3 class="fw-bold mb-4">🏁 Project Outcome</h3>

  <p>
    The completed system successfully replaced manual spreadsheets with a <strong>centralized, secure, and automated database platform</strong>.
    It improved data visibility, reduced human error, and enabled real-time reporting for better decision-making.
    Future updates will introduce <em>audit logs</em>, <em>backup functionality</em>, and <em>session-based filtering</em> to enhance scalability and traceability.
