<!-- ✅ ABOUT INTRO – 3 PARAGRAPHS -->
<section class="container py-5 text-center about-intro">
    <p class="lead fw-semibold">
        I design and deploy intelligent AI-driven systems that solve critical business inefficiencies — not as temporary fixes, but as long-term infrastructure that improves how companies operate, scale, and compete in the modern economy.
    </p>

    <p class="lead fw-semibold mt-4">
        My work goes beyond software development — I architect automated decision flows, data intelligence ecosystems, and integrated platforms that directly enhance revenue performance, workflow efficiency, and strategic clarity. Every solution is built with precision, business logic, and measurable outcomes in mind.
    </p>

    <p class="lead fw-semibold mt-4">
        Businesses work with me when they need more than code — they need intelligence, speed, and transformation. I deliver solutions that are not just functional, but smart, adaptive, and built to outperform traditional systems in both impact and longevity.
    </p>
