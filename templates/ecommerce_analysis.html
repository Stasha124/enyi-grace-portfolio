    This case study presents a detailed marketing analytics project based on a multi-year E-Commerce dataset
    covering the period from <strong>2020 to 2025</strong>. The analysis combines transactional data, clickstream
    events, customer profiles and reviews to understand how customers browse, purchase and provide feedback, and how
    these behaviours translate into revenue and long-term value for the business.
  </p>

  <p class="text-muted">
    The underlying database integrates <strong>orders</strong>, <strong>order items</strong>, <strong>products</strong>,
    <strong>customers</strong>, <strong>events/clickstream</strong>, and <strong>product reviews</strong>.
    This enables both a financial view (revenue, profit, margins) and a behavioural view
    (add-to-cart, checkout, churn risk, rating patterns). Each section below summarises a key part of the analysis,
    supported by visualisations and interpreted through a marketing lens. For every topic, the report presents a clear
    <strong>insight</strong> and a concrete <strong>recommendation</strong> for decision-making.

  <!-- 1. YEARLY REVENUE & PROFIT -->
  <div class="mb-5">
    <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">1️⃣ Yearly Revenue, Profit and Order Behaviour (2020–2025)</h3>

         alt="Yearly Revenue and Profit"
         class="img-fluid rounded shadow mb-4">

    <p>
      The first stage of the analysis focuses on overall financial performance. Transactions are grouped by
      <strong>order_year</strong> and summarised using key indicators: <strong>total revenue</strong>,
      <strong>total profit</strong>, <strong>average order value (AOV)</strong>, <strong>average profit margin</strong>,
      and <strong>order counts</strong>. This provides a clean snapshot of annual business health and growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yearly revenue fluctuates within a relatively narrow range of approximately <em>$1.47M to $1.76M</em> and profit
      margins remain stable around <strong>27–28%</strong>. Average order value stays between <strong>$166 and $173</strong>.
      There are modest dips in some years (such as 2022 and 2025), but no structural collapse in demand. Overall, the
      trend reflects a <strong>mature and resilient E-Commerce operation</strong> with predictable customer spend patterns.
    </p>

    <div class="p-3 bg-light border-start border-4 border-primary rounded mt-3">
      <h6 class="fw-bold text-primary mb-2">🧠 Insight</h6>
      <p class="mb-1">
        Stable revenue, profit and AOV indicate a strong <strong>product–market fit</strong> and a customer base that
        consistently engages with the store. However, the small downward variations in revenue show that the business is
        not fully maximising growth opportunities in certain years or seasons.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-0">
        The company enjoys a solid baseline but would benefit from targeted campaigns designed to turn flat or marginally
        negative years into periods of deliberate growth.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="p-3 bg-white border-start border-4 border-success rounded mt-3">
      <h6 class="fw-bold text-success mb-2">🎯 Recommendation</h6>
      <p class="mb-1">
        Implement a structured <strong>annual marketing calendar</strong> aligned with peak demand moments
        (e.g. New Year health campaigns, back-to-school, summer promotions, Black Friday/Cyber Monday). For each year:
      </p>
      <ul class="mb-1">
        <li>Identify historically weaker months and attach <strong>targeted promotions</strong> to boost performance.</li>
        <li>Plan <strong>category-focused campaigns</strong> around high-margin or strategic products.</li>
        <li>Monitor year-on-year revenue changes during campaign windows to quantify impact.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-0">
        This transforms a stable business into a <strong>strategically managed growth engine</strong>.

         alt="Revenue by Country"
         class="img-fluid rounded shadow mb-4">

    <p>
      To understand geographic performance, the analysis aggregates <strong>total revenue</strong>,
      <strong>total profit</strong>, <strong>average order value</strong>, and <strong>average profit margin</strong>
      by <strong>order_country</strong>. This comparison highlights which markets drive the largest share of turnover
      and which deliver the strongest economics per order.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some countries operate as <strong>high-volume, high-revenue markets</strong>, while others generate smaller sales
      volumes but stronger margins. This mix reflects differences in competition, pricing, product availability and
      local customer expectations.
    </p>

    <div class="p-3 bg-light border-start border-4 border-secondary rounded mt-3">
      <h6 class="fw-bold text-secondary mb-2">🧠 Insight</h6>
      <p class="mb-1">
        The business benefits from both <strong>mature high-volume markets</strong> and
        <strong>smaller high-margin markets</strong>. High-volume markets provide reliability and scale, whereas
        high-margin markets offer attractive unit profitability and expansion potential.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-0">
        A one-size-fits-all marketing approach would fail to exploit these distinct strengths.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="p-3 bg-white border-start border-4 border-success rounded mt-3">
      <h6 class="fw-bold text-success mb-2">🎯 Recommendation</h6>
      <p class="mb-1">
        Adopt a <strong>tiered geo-strategy</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul class="mb-1">
        <li>
          In <strong>Tier 1 (high-volume) markets</strong>, focus on retention, loyalty and subscription initiatives to
          consolidate market share.
        </li>
        <li>
          In <strong>Tier 2 (high-margin) markets</strong>, invest in acquisition: localised creatives, language support,
          partnerships with local influencers and region-specific campaigns.
        </li>
        <li>
          Track <strong>CAC</strong> and <strong>LTV</strong> per region to continuously refine budget allocation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-0">
        This ensures marketing spend is aligned with both <strong>scale and profitability</strong>.

  <!-- 3. CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION: OPT-IN & SPEND -->
  <div class="mb-5">
    <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">3️⃣ Customer Segmentation and Marketing Opt-In Behaviour</h3>

    <!-- 3a: Average Order Value by Opt-In Status -->

         alt="Average Order Value by Opt-In Status"
         class="img-fluid rounded shadow mb-4">

    <p>
      The customer and transactions tables are merged to build a customer-level dataset. For each customer, the analysis
      calculates <strong>total revenue</strong>, <strong>total orders</strong> and <strong>average order value (AOV)</strong>,
      together with demographic attributes and <strong>marketing_opt_in</strong> status.
    </p>

    <p>
      At a global level, average order value is compared between customers who <strong>opted in</strong> to marketing and
      those who <strong>opted out</strong>. The bar chart shows that both segments maintain a relatively high AOV, with
      only small differences between them.
    </p>

    <div class="p-3 bg-light border-start border-4 border-warning rounded mt-3">
      <h6 class="fw-bold text-warning mb-2">🧠 Insight</h6>
      <p class="mb-1">
        Opt-in status alone does not radically alter the value of a single order. However, this metric does not capture
        <strong>frequency</strong> or <strong>lifetime spend</strong>. Subsequent analysis shows that opt-in customers
        typically place more orders and therefore generate higher total revenue over time.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-0">
        AOV is important, but it is the combination of AOV and <strong>order frequency</strong> that defines true customer value.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- 3b: AOV by Age & Opt-In -->
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='assets/img/ecommerce/age_opt_in_aov.png') }}"
         alt="Average Order Value by Age and Opt-In"
         class="img-fluid rounded shadow my-4">

    <p>
      The second chart breaks down AOV by <strong>age band</strong> and <strong>opt-in status</strong>. It reveals that
      some age groups, particularly the <strong>35–44</strong> and <strong>65+</strong> segments, tend to have noticeably
      higher average order values. In some age groups, opt-in customers spend slightly more; in others, opt-out customers
      lead.
    </p>

    <div class="p-3 bg-light border-start border-4 border-info rounded mt-3">
      <h6 class="fw-bold text-info mb-2">🧠 Insight</h6>
      <p class="mb-1">
        Customer value is not uniform across age bands. Middle-aged and older customers often have more disposable income,
        which translates into higher average baskets. Marketing opt-in behaviour interacts with age, suggesting that some
        demographics are more receptive to ongoing communication than others.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-0">
        This provides a basis for <strong>age-aware segmentation</strong> in campaign planning.
      </p>
    </div>

         alt="Customer Value Segments vs Marketing Opt-In"
         class="img-fluid rounded shadow my-4">

    <p>
      To simplify customer value differences, the analysis groups customers into <strong>Low-Value</strong>,
      <strong>Mid-Value</strong> and <strong>High-Value</strong> segments based on total revenue. Within each group,
      the proportion of customers who opted in to marketing is compared to those who did not.
    </p>

    <p>
      Across all segments, there are more opt-in customers than opt-out customers, and this pattern persists even at the
      high-value end. This confirms that marketing subscribers are overrepresented among the most commercially valuable
      customers.
    </p>

    <div class="p-3 bg-light border-start border-4 border-secondary rounded mt-3">
      <h6 class="fw-bold text-secondary mb-2">🧠 Insight</h6>
      <p class="mb-1">
        Marketing opt-in is a strong indicator of <strong>engagement and long-term value</strong>. High-value customers are
        more likely to be reachable through email or other direct channels, which further amplifies their importance to the
        business.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-0">
        Ignoring the opt-in segment would mean under-utilising the most responsive subset of the customer base.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="p-3 bg-white border-start border-4 border-success rounded mt-3">
      <h6 class="fw-bold text-success mb-2">🎯 Recommendation</h6>
      <p class="mb-1">
        Use this segmentation to build a layered CRM strategy:
      </p>
      <ul class="mb-1">
        <li>
          Develop <strong>high-value subscriber journeys</strong> (VIP content, early access, tailored offers) for
          high-value opt-in customers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create <strong>activation campaigns</strong> to encourage mid-value and low-value customers to opt in and increase
          frequency.
        </li>
        <li>
          Adjust messaging and channel mix by age band to reflect different preferences and price sensitivities.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-0">
        This approach aligns marketing resources with the customers most likely to drive long-term growth.
      </p>

  <!-- 4. CUSTOMER INACTIVITY / CHURN -->
  <div class="mb-5">
    <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">4️⃣ Customer Inactivity and Churn Risk</h3>

         alt="Customer Inactivity Segmentation"
         class="img-fluid rounded shadow mb-4">

    <p>
      To assess churn risk, the analysis calculates each customer’s <strong>last order date</strong> and measures how
      many days have passed since that purchase. Customers are placed into inactivity bands:
      <em>Active (&lt;1 month)</em>, <em>1–3 months</em>, <em>3–6 months</em>, <em>6–12 months</em>,
      and <em>Dormant (&gt;1 year)</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The majority of customers fall into the <strong>6–12 month</strong> and <strong>&gt;1 year</strong> categories,
      indicating large pools of customers who have lapsed without re-engagement. Only a small proportion are currently
      active.
    </p>

    <div class="p-3 bg-light border-start border-4 border-danger rounded mt-3">
      <h6 class="fw-bold text-danger mb-2">🧠 Insight</h6>
      <p class="mb-1">
        The business faces significant <strong>latent churn</strong> but also possesses a substantial reactivation
        opportunity. Inactive customers are familiar with the brand, so re-engaging them is generally cheaper than
        acquiring entirely new customers.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-0">
        Without structured lifecycle marketing, this potential revenue is left on the table.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="p-3 bg-white border-start border-4 border-success rounded mt-3">
      <h6 class="fw-bold text-success mb-2">🎯 Recommendation</h6>
      <p class="mb-1">
        Implement an automated <strong>win-back programme</strong> triggered by inactivity thresholds:
      </p>
      <ul class="mb-1">
        <li>At 60–90 days: reminder campaigns with personalised product recommendations.</li>
        <li>At 6–12 months: stronger incentives (discounts, bundles, free shipping) to re-start purchasing.</li>
        <li>At &gt;1 year: “We want you back” messaging plus short surveys to identify churn drivers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-0">
        Tracking reactivation rate and incremental revenue allows the business to quantify retention ROI.

         alt="Top Products by Revenue"
         class="img-fluid rounded shadow mb-4">

    <p>
      At the product level, the analysis aggregates <strong>total revenue</strong>, <strong>total profit</strong>,
      <strong>average profit margin</strong>, and <strong>number of orders</strong> per SKU. A small number of products
      generate a disproportionate share of revenue and profit, functioning as <strong>hero products</strong> within the
      catalogue.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many of these top products also deliver healthy margins, confirming that they are both popular and profitable.
      They likely act as key entry points for new customers and as repeat purchase drivers for existing ones.

      <h6 class="fw-bold text-info mb-2">🧠 Insight</h6>
      <p class="mb-1">
        The sales pattern follows a classic <strong>80/20 rule</strong>, where a minority of products account for the
        majority of revenue. These SKUs are central to brand identity and should be treated as strategic marketing assets.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-0">
        Under-leveraging these hero products in promotional activity would limit revenue potential.
      </p>

      <h6 class="fw-bold text-success mb-2">🎯 Recommendation</h6>

        Place hero products at the heart of merchandising and marketing:
      </p>
      <ul class="mb-1">
        <li>Feature them in hero banners, recommendation carousels and category landing pages.</li>
        <li>Use them in <strong>bundle offers</strong> with complementary products to raise AOV.</li>
        <li>Highlight strong ratings and reviews on these SKUs as social proof.</li>
      </ul>

    <p>
      Customers are ranked by <strong>total revenue</strong>, and their <strong>number of orders</strong> is examined
      alongside this ranking. Some top customers reach high revenue through a smaller number of large purchases, while
      others place many more orders at slightly lower values.
    </p>

    <p>
      This highlights two archetypes: <strong>high-ticket customers</strong> and <strong>high-frequency customers</strong>.
      Both contribute significantly to revenue but are likely motivated by different things and therefore require
      different loyalty strategies.

      <h6 class="fw-bold text-secondary mb-2">🧠 Insight</h6>
      <p class="mb-1">
        A uniform approach to all high-value customers would ignore important behavioural differences. Some respond best
        to exclusivity, others to ongoing rewards and convenience. Differentiated treatment maximises the perceived value
        of the relationship.

    <p>
      Clickstream events capture behavioural interactions such as <strong>page_view</strong>, <strong>add_to_cart</strong>
      and <strong>checkout</strong>. By counting these events per year, the analysis measures how efficiently purchase
      intent (adding to cart) is translated into actual checkout attempts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most traffic goes to product pages, but there is a big drop from page views → add to cart → checkout. Checkout friction and product-page hesitation are the main weaknesses.
        Purchase events are missing product IDs, showing a tracking issue. Fixing tracking, improving product pages, and simplifying checkout will significantly increase conversions and revenue.

         class="img-fluid rounded shadow mb-4">

    <p>
      The reviews dataset records 1–5★ ratings for products. Analysing the frequency of each rating reveals a distribution
      heavily skewed towards <strong>4★ and 5★</strong> reviews, with relatively few 1★ and 2★ ratings and a moderate
      share of 3★ ratings.
    </p>

    <p>
      This pattern implies that most customers are <strong>satisfied or very satisfied</strong> with their purchases. The
      small minority of negative reviews tend to focus on specific issues such as product defects, shipping delays or
      mismatched expectations.

      <ul class="mb-1">
        <li>Showcase strong average ratings and prominent review counts on product pages and category listings.</li>
        <li>Incorporate review snippets into email campaigns and paid media creatives.</li>
        <li>Monitor low ratings and respond quickly with customer service and, where appropriate, compensation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-0">
        This reinforces confidence for prospective buyers and helps retain existing customers.

  <!-- 9. RATING & SENTIMENT TRENDS -->
  <div class="mb-5">
    <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">9️⃣ Customer Rating Trends and Sentiment Over Time</h3>

    <!-- 9a: Monthly Rating Trend with Rolling Average -->
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='assets/img/ecommerce/monthly_rating_trend.png') }}"
         alt="Monthly Ratings with Rolling Average"
         class="img-fluid rounded shadow mb-4">

    <p>
      Monthly average ratings are plotted across the entire period, together with a <strong>5-month rolling average</strong>.
      Individual months fluctuate around the long-term mean, but the rolling line smooths these variations and reveals the
      underlying trend.
    </p>

    <p>
      The smoothed curve shows that average ratings remain consistently high, with only mild dips that are later corrected.
      This demonstrates robust, sustained customer satisfaction over time rather than temporary spikes.
    </p>

    <!-- 9b: Yearly Rating Trend -->
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='assets/img/ecommerce/yearly_rating_trend.png') }}"
         alt="Yearly Rating Trend"
         class="img-fluid rounded shadow mb-4">

    <p>
      A yearly view of average ratings confirms that, despite small year-to-year changes, ratings stay within a narrow band
      close to <strong>4 out of 5</strong>. There is no evidence of long-term decline.
    </p>

    <p>
      This stability suggests that the business is maintaining product quality and service standards even as it grows and
      changes across the six-year period.
    </p>

    <!-- 9c: Ratings vs Sentiment -->
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='assets/img/ecommerce/rating_sentiment_trend.png') }}"
         alt="Rating and Sentiment Trend"
         class="img-fluid rounded shadow mb-4">

    <p>
      To complement numeric ratings, sentiment scores are derived from the text of reviews and plotted alongside average
      ratings. The sentiment curve broadly follows the same movements as the rating curve – when ratings dip slightly,
      sentiment also becomes more neutral; when ratings rise, sentiment becomes more positive.
    </p>

    <div class="p-3 bg-light border-start border-4 border-secondary rounded mt-3">
      <h6 class="fw-bold text-secondary mb-2">🧠 Insight</h6>
      <p class="mb-1">
        The combination of monthly, yearly and sentiment trends shows that customer satisfaction is both
        <strong>high and stable</strong>. Sentiment analysis validates numeric ratings and can act as an early warning
        system when subtle changes occur.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-0">
        Occasional dips likely correspond to specific operational or product issues, rather than a systemic decline in experience.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="p-3 bg-white border-start border-4 border-success rounded mt-3">
      <h6 class="fw-bold text-success mb-2">🎯 Recommendation</h6>
      <p class="mb-1">
        Integrate rating and sentiment monitoring into routine business dashboards:
      </p>
      <ul class="mb-1">
        <li>Track monthly rating and sentiment by product category and geography.</li>
        <li>Investigate sharp deviations promptly, linking them to changes in supply, pricing or service.</li>
        <li>Highlight consistently high-rated categories in marketing as “customer-loved” ranges.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-0">
        This closes the loop between customer feedback and ongoing service improvement.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- 10. PRODUCT RATING VS REVIEW VOLUME -->
  <div class="mb-5">
    <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">🔟 Product Popularity: Ratings vs Number of Reviews</h3>
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='assets/img/ecommerce/rating_vs_review_volume.png') }}"
         alt="Rating vs Review Volume"
         class="img-fluid rounded shadow mb-4">

    <p>
      Finally, average rating is plotted against <strong>number of reviews</strong> for each product. Products with
      more reviews represent higher visibility and engagement. Most products cluster between approximately
      <strong>3.8 and 4.5★</strong>, and many high-review products retain strong ratings.
    </p>

    <p>
      Popular items therefore remain well-regarded even under heavy scrutiny, while some lesser-reviewed products may be
      high quality but lack sufficient social proof to attract hesitant buyers.
    </p>

    <div class="p-3 bg-light border-start border-4 border-info rounded mt-3">
      <h6 class="fw-bold text-info mb-2">🧠 Insight</h6>
      <p class="mb-1">
        Reviews play a dual role: they reflect popularity and actively contribute to it. High-review, high-rating products
        form a set of <strong>trusted best-sellers</strong>, whereas low-review products require deliberate support to
        gain momentum.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-0">
        Combining rating level with review count allows the business to prioritise products that are both reliable and
        influential in the catalogue.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="p-3 bg-white border-start border-4 border-success rounded mt-3">
      <h6 class="fw-bold text-success mb-2">🎯 Recommendation</h6>
      <p class="mb-1">
        Use the relationship between ratings and review volume to guide merchandising decisions:
      </p>
      <ul class="mb-1">
        <li>Label high-rating, high-review products as <strong>“Top Rated”</strong> or <strong>“Most Loved”</strong>.</li>
        <li>Promote low-review but high-rating products as <strong>“Hidden Gems”</strong> to stimulate discovery.</li>
        <li>Encourage early buyers of new items to leave reviews via follow-up emails and in-app prompts.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-0">
        This strengthens the review flywheel and builds trust across the entire product range.
